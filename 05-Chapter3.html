<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I&nbsp;</span><span class="s1" style="line-height: 1.5em;">w</span><span class="s2" style="line-height: 1.5em;">oke once during the night and thought I heard a thumping coming </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">from my wardrobe, but it stopped before I could properly identify it. I smiled at the thought of the chair in the way of the secret panel and then fell back asleep.</span></p>

<p class="p3">By the time I woke properly the next morning, Mrow had slipped out with the note for Auntie. I wished him a speedy journey through the city and a quick return; I felt strangely alone without his solid bulk at the end of my bed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">A brief knock at the door announced Clack-tick&rsquo;s presence before she whirred in and began opening my blinds. &ldquo;It is a lovely day out there, Miss Thea. A whole ton of corn fell in Munchkinland last night. They say it did a bit of property damage, but at least they weren&rsquo;t dropping houses on top of anyone this time!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">I laughed with her, uneasy at the reminder that I might have discovered where those storms were coming from. Stumbling out of bed, I made my way through my morning ablutions before letting Clack-tick rope me into another green dress, this one an elegant ensemble in a rich forest green. It took a couple tries to get all of the long strips of fabric tied properly, but they gave a strangely fluid motion to the finished product. I found myself swaying in front of the mirror to watch all the different panels of the dress catch the air and move in different directions.</span></p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never get used to these.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">Clack-tick was already tidying my bed. &ldquo;Of course you will, but breakfast is cooling in your sitting room. Do you need anything else this morning?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">&ldquo;Nope, I should be just fine.&rdquo; I tore myself away from the mirror and had started towards the sitting room when Clack-tick spoke up again.</span></p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to pry, but is Mrow about this morning? I brought him a saucer of cream and a breakfast of mackerel.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;You are spoiling him.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at the thought of how delighted the furry nuisance would be when he got back from his errand. &ldquo;He went out to do his business earlier, but I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll return soon. I take it you got along with him yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Oh, yes, he&rsquo;s a charming fellow, with quite a wicked sense of humor.&rdquo; She fluffed the pillows and followed me into the main room.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised he spoke to you. He tends to keep quiet in front of strangers.&rdquo; I sat at the table and pushed out another chair for Clack-tick to sit with me.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it was just to try and convince me to bring him cream last night, but we talked about all sorts of things. He was rather interested in some of the older stories, from before Ozma came to power. We&rsquo;re not really supposed to gossip about these things, but did you know that Minister Elphred is descended from the great Witch of the West herself? She was his grandmother. Rumor has it that the Earther who was impersonating the Wizard impregnated her, then sent another Earther, Dorothy Gale, to kill her. He never let the prejudice against his family stop him, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">At the name Gale, things started to come together for me. &ldquo;Gale, you say? She wouldn&rsquo;t have happened to be a Kansas resident, would she?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p3">Clack-tick picked at a nick in the breakfast tray and nibbled on a scrap of silver. &ldquo;You know, now that you mention it, I think she was. The stories of the havoc she created are hilarious&mdash;you should see some of the plays we have about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look into that, thanks. They sound fascinating.&rdquo; I picked at the food on my plate, but any semblance of appetite I had was gone. &ldquo;Clack-tick, do you know when Elphred is expecting me this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;He said to tell you that he&rsquo;ll be in the laboratory when you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Thanks. You know, I&rsquo;m not all that hungry. I think I&rsquo;ll just take my tea over there, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo; I picked up the mug, happy to have it to warm my fingers; they were freezing as my mind raced over all the things I had learned in the last day. One, I&rsquo;m descended from the most famous character in Oz history, barring Ozma herself. Two, I was dealing with the descendent of the woman my ancestor was supposed to have murdered. I wasn&rsquo;t sure how much more complicated things could get, at this point.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Certainly. Should I leave the tray here or...?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Go ahead and leave it for now, thank you. I may change my mind later.&rdquo; We walked out into the corridor together and exchanged pleasantries before parting ways. It was as if the two men hadn&rsquo;t even left the night before; in fact, they were still wearing the same clothes and were just as deeply immersed in technical discussions as they had been when I left them. The only difference in the room was the addition of several trays of food&mdash;and Elphred&rsquo;s snowglobe on the corner of a desk in the center of the room. That must have been what he had gone to get from his room while I was snooping. I wondered if he&rsquo;d told Dr. Diggs what it did or if he had made some other excuse to bring it over.</p>

<p class="p3">I put my mug down on one of the clear spots of the table and tried to make sense of what the two men were saying, but it was incomprehensible numbers and jargon. I walked over to the arch and ran my hand over the edge of the metal.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Be careful with that! We have it set so when the next storm hits, it&rsquo;ll automatically activate.&rdquo; Dr. Diggs hurried over to me and shepherded me away from his equipment.</p>

<p class="p3">I looked at the swirling water in the snowglobe on the table, watching it a moment as it started picking up speed, then turned to Elphred. The thought of him deliberately sending these deadly storms to my home world made me feel sick. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have much longer to wait, do we? I think we&rsquo;re just about to get a storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">The klaxon went off and the light began to swirl and with the same flash-bang as the night before, the connection was made with the Earth-based laboratory.</p>

<p class="p3">Dr. Diggs was frantically running from machine to machine. &ldquo;Two in 24 hours! This is almost unheard of. How did you guess? We&rsquo;ve never been able to predict them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t guess. Minister Elphred generated it, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; I reached for the snowglobe, but the green man stepped between me and the focus of my attention, sliding it back from the edge of the table.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Now, what would lead you to believe that? The storms are natural phenomena, occurring in the rift between our worlds.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">I laughed. &ldquo;Nothing about this world is natural, it&rsquo;s all magical. The storms are no different. That snowglobe&mdash;you got it from your grandmother, the Wicked Witch of the West, a woman known for her magical skill. Who&rsquo;s to say she didn&rsquo;t figure out a way to rip through the veil? It&rsquo;s sad that she didn&rsquo;t realize she&rsquo;d bring her own demise through the veil.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">The green man&rsquo;s eyes flashed, actually sparking in his anger. &ldquo;That Earther bitch didn&rsquo;t kill my grandmother, only scarred her for life. She was hideous afterwards, and my mother barely lived long enough to birth me and then left me there in that castle, with nothing but a bitter cripple and all the time in the world to learn her magic.&rdquo; Elphred collected himself and smoothed his jacket compulsively. Sparks jumped back and forth from the wool material to his fingers.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the real reason you are so eager to make this work? I mean, really?&rdquo; I walked over to the machines and slapped one on the side. I was shaking, but if I backed down now, I&rsquo;d probably just be dead before I could tell anyone else what I&rsquo;d figured out. If my grandmother, or whatever, had managed to best his grandmother, the odds were in my favor, right?&nbsp; &ldquo;I bet it&rsquo;s not for trade or immigration, or anything remotely beneficial for either Earth or Oz.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">Elphred narrowed his eyes, and then came to some sort of decision. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re entirely right. And now I&rsquo;m going to have to speed up the timetable because you&rsquo;re just as nosy as that little Kansas whore.&rdquo; The minister made his way over to Dr. Diggs. &ldquo;Your services are no longer needed, cousin.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Cousin? I, what&mdash;&rdquo; was all the man managed before Elphred downed him with a rather large electrical pulse. I hoped it wasn&rsquo;t strong enough to kill the scientist, and decided to keep touching the machine in case Elphred tried to do the same to me. The electrical current would carry through me and fry his equipment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">Instead, he stalked over to the snowglobe and gave it an especially vicious swirl. &ldquo;That should keep the storm going until I can get the feedback loop started.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Feedback loop?&rdquo; That didn&rsquo;t sound good, not in the slightest. I peered around the edge of the machine to see what he was doing with the dials.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Feedback, to set up a recycling of power through the storm with these nifty machines here. It will keep the rift open and growing between our worlds until the instability it introduces to your Earth is so great that it rips the planet to pieces. You Earthers are a plague. Every time you make it over here, you destroy something else. Your refugees take and take without any thought as to how they can give back. I can think of no more fitting audience to Earth&rsquo;s destruction than the descendants of that blithering idiot wizard and the gingham-wearing bitch who ruined more lives than she ever knew.&rdquo; Elphred had made his way over to the capacitors and grabbed them, crackling with energy that he fed into the machines, more and more until the sheath of power that swirled around him paled and then finally disappeared.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">I wasn&rsquo;t sure if he had drained himself into the machine or just reduced his power levels, but I hoped that he&rsquo;d let it all go&mdash;otherwise, what I was going to do next was really stupid.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">Slowly taking my hand off the side of the machine, I started inching towards the snowglobe. If I could just grab it and break it, or remove the map, or something, that should stop the travel-storm. Right? I told myself yes again. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what else to try, but seeing as it controlled the storms, it seemed fairly logical. I could have tried messing with the machines, but that might just make things worse.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; I froze in place, halfway between the snowglobe and the machines, not sure which way I should leap, but I was too slow. Elphred grabbed my wrist, spinning me away from the globe, and I could feel my hair start to stand on end. Apparently he wasn&rsquo;t so drained after all, but I wasn&rsquo;t dead yet, so that was something.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;You are going to stand here and watch.&rdquo; He yanked me in front of the arch, hard enough to make me yelp. Off-balance, I fell to the floor beside him, my arm still in his grip.</p>

<figure><img alt="Alt Text" class="itooz_003png" src="tooz_003.png" /></figure>

<p class="p3">On the other side of the portal, you could already see the strain of the warring physics from either side of the veil. Sinkholes were opening in the floor of the lab and outside the window, storms swirled against each other. A hum started to fill the room, ugly and sour, making my teeth and stomach ache.</p>

<p class="p3">I could feel the tears on my face, and whether they were for my home world or just from the pain in my arm, I wasn&rsquo;t sure. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to do this! You have me&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it just my family you&rsquo;re so mad at? Mine and Dr. Diggs? Why can&rsquo;t you just punish us and leave our world alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a plague, that&rsquo;s why. Have you seen the shape your world is in? Constant war and disease and famine. You Earthers need to be wiped out once and for all to keep you from finding your way across the border ever again.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">My attention was drawn away from the arch by a flicker of gray at the corner of my eye and I looked away just in time to see Mrow&rsquo;s tail disappear behind a table. I almost laughed with relief, but carefully kept the grimace on my face, which was not hard with the torque being applied to my shoulder.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">Elphred was grinning, wide and hard, fixated on the destruction on the other side of the arch. &ldquo;Almost&mdash;it&rsquo;s almost reached a self-sustaining threshold.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all for nothing without the magic your grandmother left you, right? Your globe? Won&rsquo;t that be useless once you destroy Earth since it controls the travel-storms? It might as well just be a broken pile of glass at that point.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;ll have rid the worlds of you and that will be worth more than all the magical trinkets in my world.&rdquo; He turned to gesture at the globe and blanched, seeing Mrow casually rubbing up against said trinket. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; He tried to lunge for my cat, but I caught him around the knees and brought him down while Mrow worked the globe closer to the edge of the table.</p>

<p class="p3">It hurt, trying to pin the larger man with a shoulder on fire, but Auntie hadn&rsquo;t wanted any of her people to be helpless against the raveges of other scavengers, and she had taught me well. I pinched and pried at the delicate places, not so different on a witch&rsquo;s body than an Earther&rsquo;s, and Elphred screamed, half in rage, half in pain. He came back at me, trying to dislodge my arms from his body and I flipped over, using his momentum to toss him back towards the arch while I went for my knife.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">He was lying half across the threshold when the sound of shattering glass filled a suddenly silent room. Mrow let out a perfectly innocent &ldquo;Whoops!&rdquo; before the room was filled with tearing winds and a torrential downpour. I threw myself under the nearest table and tried to protect myself from the flying debris. The storm faded quickly, and it took me a moment to realize that the pounding I was hearing was at the door to the laboratory rather than from the storm. I didn&rsquo;t know how the door had gotten locked, but it was and I hurried over to open it, shaking from the chill of the sudden downpour. Armed guards started to run in, and then slowed as they took in the wreck of the room, tapestries torn from the walls and furniture in broken, sodden pieces. Mrow sat on a table in the middle of it all, muttering to himself and desperately trying to clean his fur. Dr. Diggs still hadn&rsquo;t moved and was facedown in a puddle, so I hurried to his side as the guards stood stupidly around the room. I struggled to turn him over and then tried to find a pulse.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Are you all going to stand their staring, or will one of you call a doctor?&rdquo; I sighed in relief when Dr. Diggs started to cough and brought up a lungful of water. I propped him upright and turned to find the guards staring at the arch. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">I came back around the tables and finally saw what they were staring at. &ldquo;Well I guess that answers the question of what happens when you collapse the tear with something in it.&rdquo; Elphred&rsquo;s legs and the bottom half of his torso pointed towards the arch, but beyond the arch, there was nothing. &ldquo;Good riddance,&rdquo; I muttered to myself. I started to shake in earnest and sat down hard on the one couch that had remained upright. A guard came over and unbuttoned his coat and draped it silently over my shoulders. The captain of the squad finally came to his senses and started snapping orders before coming over and sitting beside me on the divan.</span></p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ve just been through a terrible shock, miss, but we need to know what happened here.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I sniffed and wiped at my face, trying to remove some of the water and grit, while giving myself a little extra time to think. I knew now that my family had a strong history with this place, and a not altogether happy one. I didn&rsquo;t know who that would matter to, or who I might have to answer to for what had just happened, so I gave an extra hard shudder and sobbed out, &ldquo;The machines, they just&hellip;oh, it was horrible.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p3">I dropped my head to his shoulder and started to cry. The tears weren&rsquo;t even faked; I hurt something fierce, my adrenaline was rapidly fading, and I was starting to freeze. He gestured for a guard to come and take me from the room, giving the man whispered instructions before letting me leave.</p>

<p class="p3">I was taken to my quarters where Clack-tick was anxiously waiting for me. She informed me that news traveled fast and asked whether I was hurt. I mumbled no. She shooed me into the bedroom, leaving the guard at my front door, and started to help me out of the soaked silks. I cried out when she tried to take the dress off my injured shoulder and she tsked and said yes, I did indeed need a doctor, but after a hot bath. I wasn&rsquo;t going to argue.</p>

<p class="p3">I hadn&rsquo;t been submerged in the blissfully hot water long when a gentle pat at the door preceded Mrow into the room. He was already looking quite fluffy and informed me that Clack-tick had a hair-dryer of sorts built into her arm.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;So, what are you going to say?&rdquo; He leaped onto the thick tile edge of the tub and sat, tail curled around his feet to ensure it didn&rsquo;t accidentally get any wetter.</p>

<p class="p3">I sighed, and slipped farther into the tub. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. The truth seems awfully dangerous right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Mmm.&rdquo; He narrowed his eyes in thought and sat silent for a moment. &ldquo;May I make a suggestion?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stop you if you wanted to.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Very true. At any rate, this was a tragic accident. Minister Elphred had gathered together three people from families that were once enemies in an effort at finding some peace, through working on a machine to stabilize and neutralize the danger of crossing between our worlds, but due to an unforeseen mechanical malfunction, he tragically died.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">I thought about it for a moment, swirling the water back and forth. &ldquo;You think that&rsquo;s the best direction to go with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;It does two things. One, it absolves you of any responsibility. You could even play up his heroic role in all of it. Two, it lets the world know who you are while at the same time negating the danger from any who may have been loyal to Elphred. Well, at least some of the danger. The truth about your lineage was bound to come out sooner or later anyway, but in this fashion you at least get to control its impact.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">I stared at my cat, astounded at his deviousness. &ldquo;You know, with a mind like yours, Auntie should have been taking business advice from you for years.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;What makes you think she hasn&rsquo;t been?&rdquo; Mrow leaped down from the tub and started to make his way out of the bathroom when I had a thought.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;What about the doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Mrow snorted. &ldquo;His brains got so fried, I doubt he&rsquo;ll even remember</span> his own name in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
