<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">week later, Dr. Diggs, Mrow, and I stood outside the receiving&nbsp; hall at the palace. Diggs listed a bit to one side and had a tendency to drool, but other than that seemed to have come out of the ordeal without major injury. Mrow had been right that he remembered nothing from the day of the &ldquo;accident.&rdquo; My arm was in a sling, but the shoulder was healing quickly, and no one had even commented on the hand-shaped electrical burn on my forearm. I&rsquo;d had a story ready about how Elphred had yanked me out of harm&rsquo;s way when the machines began to malfunction, and I was disappointed I hadn&rsquo;t gotten to use it. But Mrow had repeated constantly over the last week to keep the lie simple; it was easier to remember that way.</span></p>

<p class="p3">We were waiting for our summons in to see Ozma and I was more than a little nervous. It was the first time I was going to meet the fairy ruler, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect. This was a formal ceremony to receive honors, posthumously in Elphred&rsquo;s case, and I felt like a total cheat.</p>

<p class="p3">The trumpets blew and I had no more time for rumination. I stood straight in the kelly-green ballgown I&rsquo;d been shoehorned into and strode into the hall with Mrow and Dr. Diggs. At the end of the much-too-long hall, we stopped in front of Her Highness and I curtsied while Mrow blinked and Diggs tried to bow. He wobbled a bit. The murmur of the crowded hall was making me even more nervous. I wasn&rsquo;t sure how many people in the hall were here to gawk at a descendant of Dorothy, and how many were here because they had known that Elphred would never have willingly made peace with me.</p>

<p class="p3">Ozma held up her hand and once the crowd had quieted, made a short speech about grand gestures of peace and noble sacrifices, and then called us up onto the dais one at a time to put a heavy medal around our necks.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">She called me second, and when I bowed in front of her, she murmured, &ldquo;Well met, granddaughter Gale. Dorothy was a treasure to us, and I have a feeling you will be much the same. Even if you do have an affinity for half-truths.&rdquo; She winked one cat-slitted eye and I felt infinitely better. She knew what had really happened, but she was willing to play the game as I'd laid it out. It was safer for all involved.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">We turned to the crowd and Ozma raised her hands. &ldquo;I present to you, Earthers worthy of Oz!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">The applause was deafening and there was even some cheering. I smiled and curtsied, and then we started to make our way out of the hall as we had been instructed. There was going to be a feast later: all Earther dishes in our honor. I shook hands all the way out, and a young woman carrying a glass cat palmed me a note just as we were exiting the hall. Once the doors had closed, I turned my back to Diggs, who was staring at a tapestry on the wall and drooling, and opened the note.&nbsp;</p>
