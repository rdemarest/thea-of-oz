<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I&nbsp;</span>wasn't<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;lying when I said I had never seen the inside of the palace. As such, I was suitably impressed when Minister Elphred&rsquo;s carriage wove its way up the main boulevard and into the roundabout at the main entrance. The sprawling towers meandered over almost two acres of the city, with no real pattern or plan that I could see. It was all true emerald green, some portions even looking like they were carved from their namesake rock.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p3">I had heard legends about how the city was originally white and everyone just wore green glasses. When they tried to do away with the glasses, no one could see properly for the shining of it all, so the witches had gotten together and figured out a way to make everything green for real. To be honest, I was rather sick of the color and did everything I could at home to cover it up.</p>

<p class="p3">A footman opened my door and I stepped out with my basket, craning my neck to look up to the top of the grand entranceway. Only a small door was open for us, cut into the larger doors, and I wondered just how heavy the main doors were to open.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;After you, Miss Thea.&rdquo; Elphred gestured for me to precede him and I did, happily forgetting the danger Auntie had implied was lurking and letting myself dive into the grandeur and opulence before me. The vestibule was as large as our whole apartment complex, with staircases and hallways winding away into the distance. The whole spectacle was topped off by green crystal chandeliers lit even this early in the day.</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not &lsquo;miss&rsquo; anything, Minister, I&rsquo;m just plain Thea.&rdquo; I stepped aside to let him in after me without having to give up my perspective of the main hall.&nbsp; Mrow was purring again, hard enough to make his basket rock.</span></p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;As you wish. We&rsquo;ll be staying in the west wing and I&rsquo;ve arranged for a suite just next to mine, with the good doctor across the hall. We&rsquo;ll be able to work together and be uninterrupted for the time being.&rdquo; He strode down the hall and I had to scramble to catch up, my black flats sliding on the polished stone.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;ll see Ozma while I'm here?&rdquo; I&rsquo;d always heard such wonderful stories about the fairy princess, and I rather hoped he&rsquo;d say yes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;I'm afraid not. Ozma doesn't live here full time anymore&mdash;she prefers one of the outlying palaces, away from the bustle of the government she created. This building is almost entirely given over to governmental function and the apartments for the ministers and guests who need to be...impressed upon.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, I added, &ldquo;I guess that makes our job a little easier, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">A small smile played at the corner of Elphred&rsquo;s mouth as he strode along. &ldquo;That it does. Here is your room. You&rsquo;ll find the closet stocked with more appropriate clothing, and everything should be in your size. A maid will be along shortly&mdash;let her know if things don&rsquo;t fit properly. I shall expect you for dinner in a half hour in my chambers, where I will introduce you to the doctor and then we can get to work. Until then.&rdquo; He clicked his heels together and gave an abbreviated bow, then left me standing in my open doorway.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Well. I guess it&rsquo;s a good thing I didn't have any urgent questions,&rdquo; I told Mrow, a bit annoyed.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;I rather think he&rsquo;d have avoided answering any of the interesting ones anyway.&rdquo; He leapt out of the basket, nearly causing me to drop it, and sauntered into the room. &ldquo;At least our quarters are bigger than that rat hole you call an apartment.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">I had to agree with the cat. Our entire apartment&mdash;all three bedrooms, kitchen, and living room&mdash;could have fit in the sitting room of my new suite. I dropped my basket on a divan and wandered through one of the doorways to find myself in a spa-like bathroom that included a green glass air-jet tub. I was definitely going to have to try that out later. My current goal was to find the bedroom and wardrobe that the Minister had promised.</p>

<p class="p3">The next door I tried led to the bedroom, complete with an enormous four-poster feather bed. I sighed, thinking I was going to have to sleep on the couches since down and I did not particularly get along, but made my way to the standing wardrobe. I threw open the doors to find rack after rack of high Ozite fashion. There were gorgeous silks and satins in a dizzying array of greens and I couldn&rsquo;t wait to try some of it on. I chose a delicate seafoam number and hurriedly stripped out of my worn gingham.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">After five minutes, Mrow was rolling on the floor laughing and I had to admit defeat. I&rsquo;d never had the opportunity to wear Ozite fashion since Auntie didn&rsquo;t allow it, saying we needed to stay proud of our Earth heritage, and the array of ties and fobs and clips and buttons on this dress had soundly outsmarted me.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Oh dear, that&rsquo;s entirely wrong.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">I scrambled to cover myself but relaxed at the site of a clockwork maid in the doorway. She was a newer model, rather delicately featured, and she moved with a stuttering grace, belying her clockwork nature.</span></p>

<p class="p3">I smiled, a bit embarrassed, and tried to disentangle myself from the mess I'd created. &ldquo;Sorry, it&rsquo;s my first time with this kind of clothing and I just...it doesn't make sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Here, let me.&rdquo; She came over and had me extricated in a few moments. She hesitated at the knife sheathed on my thigh, but said nothing. With another few swift movements she had me properly clothed and tied up. &ldquo;My name is Clack-tick. I'll be your maid while you're here.&rdquo;</p>

<figure><img alt="Alt Text" class="itooz_002png" src="tooz_002.png" /></figure>

<p class="p3">Her voice was bland and didn't betray the usual anger I heard when I talked with other Ozites in the marketplace. &ldquo;It doesn't bother you that you were assigned to an Earther?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;To be honest, I volunteered. I was curious. I&rsquo;m only a few months old and I've never seen an Earther.&rdquo; She swept around the room, gathering my old Earth dress and holding it up to study its shape, before draping it over her arm. &ldquo;I'll take this to be cleaned.&rdquo; The maid hesitated before blurting, &ldquo;Do you mind...that is, were you an intentional?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I smiled and shook my head. &ldquo;Me? No, I&rsquo;ve been here since I was small. My family was picked up in the first couple years of severe global warming by one of the travel-storms and dropped here before we knew it wasn&rsquo;t suicide to go running into tornadoes. At least, not guaranteed suicide. All my family still died. I was raised by Ms. Gertrude.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p3">Clack-tick&rsquo;s eyes lit up a startling shade of orange. &ldquo;The Garbage Queen.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Well, yes. Do you know her?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Not personally, but her company finds some of the most delicious oils and lubricants. You Earthers sure know how to take care of a machine.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">I was really starting to like Clack-tick. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll see if Auntie has anything lying about the next time I see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Perhaps she has some WD-40? That stuff is simply...divine. I&rsquo;ve only ever had a drop or two.&rdquo; Her eyes brightened and she gave a happy little jangle.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;I think we have some. I&rsquo;ll be sure to bring it.&rdquo; I spun, trying to see all of myself in the full-length mirror.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you think? Can I pass as an Ozite in this dress?&rdquo; The wraparound dress draped a little too well, and I wondered how long the Minister had been planning to request my presence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Just so. No one will be able to tell the difference until you talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">I shot her a wry smile before going back to playing with the silk. &ldquo;Thanks for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Oh! No, I only meant that you have a beautiful Earther accent...I wouldn&rsquo;t change it for anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Well, thanks. I guess I&rsquo;ll go see if the Minister is ready for dinner, even though I&rsquo;m a bit early. I&rsquo;d rather get started on this project.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Yes, of course. Can I get anything else for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">Mrow started up a pathetic pantomime on the floor, letting out piteous meows, to indicate that he was dying of starvation. &ldquo;If you have a plate of tuna for my cat, it would not go amiss. He&rsquo;s a rascal, though. Don&rsquo;t let him con you into anything richer; he&rsquo;s supposed to be losing weight.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Of course! The mighty animal needs to keep up his strength.&rdquo; Clack-tick leaned down to tickle Mrow&rsquo;s stomach and he promptly swiped at her metal arm, creating a screech that set my teeth on edge. &ldquo;How adorable and fierce!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;If you say so. Mrow, behave yourself: I&rsquo;ll see you in a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">I made my way back to the hall and then down to the door marked with Elphred&rsquo;s name and title. I knocked briefly and opened the door to find the green man hastily setting down a large snowglobe. &ldquo;Oh, forgive me, I&rsquo;m early.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;No, please, come in. The food should be brought up shortly and our scientist will be joining us at any moment.&rdquo; He gestured toward a table set up in the middle of the room.</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I made my way over and he held out a chair for me. I was reluctant to put my back to him, but it would have been rude to decline, so I sat, jarred a little as he pushed the chair in faster than was strictly necessary.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p3">There was a moment of silence and I scrambled for a topic of conversation. &ldquo;That was a pretty snowglobe you were holding when I came in. I wasn&rsquo;t aware they made them on this side of the Veil...or is it Earth-made?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;This?&rdquo; Elphred picked it back up, but made no motion to let me see it better. He swirled it around, smiling faintly. &ldquo;No, no, it was made over here. A long time ago, in fact. It was my Grandmother&rsquo;s; before she passed away, she gave it to me. It&rsquo;s not much more than a bauble, but it&rsquo;s the only thing I have left of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">I kicked myself mentally. Of course I&rsquo;d fixate on the one thing in the room that created an awkward conversation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to bring up any painful memories.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Oh, they are not so much painful anymore as nostalgic. I have some beautiful memories of Grandmother from when I was very young.&rdquo; There was a knock at the door and Elphred put down the snowglobe and strode over to answer it.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Dr. Diggs, how good of you to join us! Please, come in.&rdquo; A rather unimpressive young man in a worn leather jacket entered, his hair in disarray. He reached out and grabbed the older man&rsquo;s hand, shaking vigorously.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Minister, thank you again for your hospitality. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what kind of facilities I&rsquo;d have to work with or whether I&rsquo;d just be in an open field and, let me tell you, this palace is far beyond what I could have hoped for.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Yes, yes, we&rsquo;re glad we could be of some help to you in your efforts. I know it&rsquo;s important to you to get the travel-storm phenomena sorted out as soon as possible.&rdquo; Elphred guided Dr. Diggs into the room and shut the door. &ldquo;However, this evening, I&rsquo;d like to introduce you to an influential young woman in our city, Miss Thea Gale.&rdquo; I stood, offering my hand to the doctor, surprised at how young he was.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;A pleasure to meet you, a real pleasure.&rdquo; He smiled as we shook hands, though he seemed distracted by something I couldn&rsquo;t see.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;And you, Doctor. I hear you have a way that might actually let me see my home dimension and let me live to talk about it.&rdquo; I gently disengaged my hand and sat again.</p>

<p class="p3">The two men joined me at the table. &ldquo;Well, yes, I suppose I do, though the purpose is more for bringing people over here rather than sending people back. Our world is falling to pieces and trying to take the human race with it. It is imperative that we find someplace to salvage what we can. Isn&rsquo;t that right, Minister?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Please, Elphred will do. We&rsquo;re all friends here. And, yes, our goal is to stabilize a connection with your world.&rdquo; I noticed he didn&rsquo;t say what for, and I wasn&rsquo;t going to speak up. I was this close to actually getting to see my world and didn&rsquo;t want to ruin it by spoiling Elphred&rsquo;s plans, even if I personally thought they were despicable. Maybe I would be able to convince him to let through some refugees later along with his trade shipments. He probably would, if they were willing to pay enough.</p>

<p class="p3">I twiddled with my napkin while I waited for our food to arrive. &ldquo;Dr. Diggs, how was it you managed to figure it out? Stabilizing a travel-storm, I mean. It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;ve had a lot of time to study this sort of thing, since it&rsquo;s a fairly new phenomena.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">Elphred laughed. &ldquo;Oh, Diggs here isn&rsquo;t a stranger to our world, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not. Well, not entirely, I should say, since this is my first trip over. My great-grandfather wrote down some incredible stories about this other world, Oz, that he&rsquo;d managed to get to by flying through a storm. Most of the family thought he was just nuts, but I couldn&rsquo;t let it go. I have dual degrees in meteorology and physics, specifically multiple dimension theory. It wasn&rsquo;t until those storm hunters were caught in a travel-storm and actually managed to transmit data from this side that my work was taken seriously. Let me tell you, the funding came pouring in.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">A bell chime interrupted his explanation, and three Munchkins came in with heavily laden trays. They moved in synchronicity, placing the trays in front of us, removing the lids, and bowing before retreating through the same door they had entered from. They left behind beds of lettuce with dollops of three-bean salad, egg salad, tuna salad, chicken salad, pasta salad, potato salad, and a few other sticky, creamy masses I couldn&rsquo;t identify.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;I heard that on warm evenings like this, Earthers occasionally just eat a salad, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure what kind of salads you two would prefer, so I had them give each of you a variety. Please, dig in.&rdquo; Elphred spread his napkin in his lap and started to pick at the pasta salad on his plate.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Thank you, egg salad is my favorite.&rdquo; Dr. Diggs picked up his fork and dug in with gusto while I sighed and silently wished for a steak. I settled for tuna salad instead and ate quietly while the two men talked science that went straight over my head. We finished in short order and Elphred suggested a walk over to the doctor&rsquo;s quarters to see his equipment, now that it was all set up and calibrated.</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">&ldquo;The only part I don&rsquo;t quite understand is the formation of an actual travel-storm as compared to a basic storm on Earth,&rdquo; the doctor said. &ldquo;We know that not all of the major storms split the veil between our worlds, but we have yet to figure out what the difference is. We know travel-storms are stronger and much deadlier, hence all the advancements we&rsquo;re making in travel-pods. All my machine can do is latch on to a tear when it forms and stabilize it until it closes. The units on either side of the veil anchor it at ground level in a single spot for safer passage. Our machines here will be able to link with the ones on Earth during the next travel-storm and we&rsquo;ll be able to pass things through. Really, I can&rsquo;t tell you how excited I am to finally be testing this.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;As am I, doctor. Truly.&rdquo; We had entered the lab at this point, and I wondered at Elphred&rsquo;s patience with the Earther scientist. He just went on and on and it was hard to get a word in edgewise. I wanted to get to the hole-making so I could see Earth again. The room had an arch big enough for a large vehicle to pass through, with a bank of large machines wired to it. Surprisingly, they were on.</p>

<p class="p3">I interrupted the doctor as he was explaining to Elphred the physics of latching on to a travel-storm. &ldquo;How are your machines working? There isn&rsquo;t electricity over here, and their electromagic doesn&rsquo;t work over there, so you can&rsquo;t design a machine around it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The doctor scowled at my interruption, but cleared his throat and leaned over me, as if I were a small child. &ldquo;Well, I had designed a generator to run on steam power, but Minister Elphred here had a better idea.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p3">Elphred held up his hand and played with a spark that he sent dancing through his fingers. &ldquo;I simply juiced up his capacitors myself. Old family trick.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">The spark crackled and evaporated and the green man rubbed his hands together briskly, ignoring me once more. &ldquo;Are we ready to turn this on and link up with its brother machine?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll need to wait for a travel-storm, since we can&rsquo;t create the link without one, but&mdash;&rdquo; The doctor was interrupted by a siren and whirling red light going off on top of the machine. &ldquo;What providence! We have one now.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Yes, what luck.&rdquo; Elphred tucked his hands carefully into his pockets and stepped back from the machines, smiling. Dr. Diggs didn&rsquo;t notice, as all of his attention was now focused on his machines and computers, punching in commands and tweaking dials. I carefully avoided looking at Elphred as he retreated behind me to a divan at the back of the room; I didn&rsquo;t want him to notice me noticing that he wasn&rsquo;t surprised in the slightest by the travel-storm&rsquo;s arrival.</p>

<p class="p3">There was a fierce electric crackle filling the air and the arch began to glow and pulse with miniature lightning. I decided the back of the room with a shifty Elphred was probably safer than the new machines, even with my misgivings, and retreated to his side. &ldquo;Are you sure this won&rsquo;t just blow up? I mean, has he even had the opportunity to turn it on since he got over here?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;No, not as such, but I have faith.&rdquo; I could smell the ozone of gathered power surrounding him and I edged away a bit.</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">&ldquo;Which is why you&rsquo;re gathering a force field around you, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p3">His lips quirked in a faint smile. &ldquo;While I have faith, it doesn't hurt to hedge your bets.&rdquo; He made a small gesture and the bubble of power around him expanded to include me as well. I shivered as the wave of it passed through me, not liking the cold sensation, and liking even less that he hadn&rsquo;t asked.</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s4">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize you were a witch. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve never met one before.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;What makes you think I&rsquo;m not a fairy?&rdquo; Elphred was watching the doctor with great concentration.</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">&ldquo;Well, the stories say they all left ages ago&hellip;all except Ozma, that is.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p3">The green man snorted. &ldquo;Stories are often wrong. For example, Ozma is hardly the fairy princess they sing about.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;What is she then?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">A blinding white flash of light and a clap of thunder reverberated through the room, and when I could see again, Dr. Diggs was leaning through the archway into a white sterile laboratory, conversing with two young Earther adults, one a tall gangly man, the other a much stouter woman. Elphred was standing at his machines, studying the settings and readouts, ignoring everything else around him. I made my way over to the archway, still reeling a bit from the blast of the connection.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;The flowmeter?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Stable.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;How are the energy readouts on the flux capacitor?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">&ldquo;I told you, Jason, we&rsquo;re not naming it that. It&rsquo;s the Diggs Stabilizer.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Fine. How are the energy readouts on the Diggs Stabilizer?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Normal. Perfectly normal! It worked!&rdquo; The three scientists shook hands across the threshold as I came up behind Diggs.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Could...I mean, if you&rsquo;re through making sure it&rsquo;s safe, might I go over? Just for a minute?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">Diggs turned and smiled. &ldquo;Of course, dear girl, of course. Make it quick; we don&rsquo;t know how long the connection will last.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and stepped through the thin wavering light between me and Earth. The air instantly felt different; dry and too thin, compared to the atmosphere of Oz. I peered around the laboratory before going over to a window to look out at Earth. &ldquo;Where are we? I don&rsquo;t see any storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Canada, Ontario. Its relatively tornado-free and the extreme temperatures don&rsquo;t get as bad up here during the summer. The storm is actually centered over...&rdquo; Jason consulted a readout. &ldquo;Oklahoma right now. It&rsquo;s a doozy too. Good thing all that land is just corporate farm now.&rdquo; Jason came up to stand behind me. &ldquo;Beautiful, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">It wasn&rsquo;t. It was dull and bleak. There were hardly any trees, and a strong wind was whipping up dust clouds that occasionally obscured the window. The colors lacked any sort of vibrancy, the life they had in Oz. My skin itched with the emptiness of the air and I shivered. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go back now. Just, you know, so I don&rsquo;t get stranded.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">I retreated back through the arch and settled unsteadily into a chair by the door. Earth had felt so wrong. I had felt like I couldn&rsquo;t breathe&mdash;it all just seemed so dead compared to here. Even the fabric of the chair under me felt like it could come to life at any moment. Which, in reality, it could. I shuddered as the last of the itchy feeling left my skin, soothed by the wash and flow of the power of Oz.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;...no, once we lose the storm, the connection will snap. We&rsquo;re not sure what would happen to anything in the field when that happens. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend connecting to every storm, either. This field generator puts a great deal of stress on the veil and I can&rsquo;t guarantee we won&rsquo;t start damaging it. Who knows what kind of effect that would have.&rdquo; Dr. Diggs was recording some numbers off of one of the screens and Elphred was peering through the arch when it gave an audible pop and the other laboratory vanished. Elphred jerked his head back and rubbed his nose at the backwash of power.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Fascinating. Tell me more about the stress on the veil. Does it depend on the amount of matter going back and forth?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Not so far as I can tell. It seems the greater stress is on our side&mdash;while you get dumps of physical objects and people, the storms are ripping into our reality with a foreign energy that our physics just don&rsquo;t know how to respond to properly. It breaks apart the basic laws of our reality in a localized area for a short period of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">They started to wax technical again and I tuned them out. I was shaking from my encounter with my home world and just wanted to curl up under a blanket until I figured out whether I was disappointed. This morning I still thought I&rsquo;d never be able to see Earth again and now...I don&rsquo;t think I wanted to go through the veil again. But I was an Earther! All I should want is to go back, to see it once more, to run across the hay fields on my family&rsquo;s farm.</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s4">I stood abruptly, causing the two men to pause in their conversation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling a bit shaky. Today has been rather over-stimulating, I&rsquo;m afraid. Do please excuse me, gentlemen.&rdquo; They acknowledged me with a nod and a wave before going back to the nitty-gritty bits of their machine.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">I was so preoccupied by trying to figure out how to feel about having just been on Earth again that I accidentally entered Elphred&rsquo;s room instead of mine. I stopped as soon as I noticed the dinner table, and had turned to leave when my eye was caught by the snowglobe. I had always loved snowglobes, and decided that a look couldn&rsquo;t hurt. It was rather large, so I didn&rsquo;t pick it up, but I peered in, marveling at how the glitter and sand inside of it was moving independently of any motion on my part. It was swirling hard enough to mostly obscure the interior, but calmed as I watched, so that I could see that it was empty of any figures or props. Instead, a small map of Oklahoma was under its clear base.</span></p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Hsst...Thea!&rdquo; Mrow was in a doorway that I could only assume led back to Elphred&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get in here?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Secret panel, but I can hear them coming from down the hall, so you better follow me, fast.&rdquo; I hurried after him and ducked into the wardrobe in the bedroom, carefully closing the false panel behind me.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Why in Oz is there a false panel between our rooms, and how did you open it?&rdquo; I straightened the clothes in my closet, then had the idea of taking the chair from the vanity and wedging it against the false back. I didn&rsquo;t want Elphred to be able to use that panel later.</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">&ldquo;I would wager it&rsquo;s so he can keep an eye on you, but that&rsquo;s just paranoid ol&rsquo; me.&rdquo; Mrow sat and began to vigorously wash his hind leg.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">&ldquo;Like that&rsquo;s not creepy. Nor the fact that he was playing with this great big snowglobe that had a map of Oklahoma under it and then the travel-storm that hit this evening was tearing apart the same state.&rdquo; I struggled at the fasteners on the dress; they were just out of reach.</span></p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Need some help?&rdquo; Mrow unsheathed his claws and began to carefully clean them as well.</p>

<p class="p3">I rolled my eyes and managed to get the dress off over my head. &ldquo;Seriously, do you think that might be what causes the travel-storms? That ball?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">&ldquo;What, and he&rsquo;s aiming them at Oklahoma? There&rsquo;s not much there.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Just farms apparently.&rdquo; I paused as I pulled a much simpler green shift over my head. &ldquo;Which brings over all the produce it rips out the ground, which a savvy Minister of Trade might take advantage of.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;But no one knows how or where the travel-storms form. What makes you think this globe might do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;One, he&rsquo;s a witch.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;I could have told you that. He reeks of magic.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">I made a face at the cat and flounced on the bed. &ldquo;Two, he was playing with the globe before dinner. After dinner, there was conveniently a travel-storm, and then when I accidentally wandered into his room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Sure, accidentally.&rdquo; I threw a pillow at my cat. He avoided it, then joined me on the bed.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;Accidentally. It was still swirling and then it finally settled down and I could see the map of Oklahoma.&rdquo; I started scratching Mrow in his favorite spot, just under his chin, and he started purring.</p>

<p class="p3">He paused just long enough to concede that I might have a point, then returned to blissfully accepting my attention.</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;The question becomes, is any of that important?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">Mrow pulled away to roll over onto his back. &ldquo;How about you just give me a note to drag across town and let Gertrude decide for herself?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p3">&ldquo;I think I will do just that.&rdquo; I spent the next half hour composing a note to Auntie telling her everything that had happened since I had arrived, cutting out the touristy bits near the beginning and the uncomfortable ones Earth-side, then folded it up and tucked it under Mrow&rsquo;s basket for him to take to Auntie in the morning. I hoped she would have some idea of how to handle this charged situation, or else I'd be forced to take drastic, and probably irresponsible, action.</p>
